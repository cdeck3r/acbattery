<h1>About</h1>

<article>
This project introduces an AC battery designed for integration with a photovoltaic (PV) power plant. 

The system is installed in a residential setting, specifically a single-family home. The PV power plant has a maximum output of 600W, while the battery has a storage capacity of 1kWh. Despite the relatively small scale of this setup, the efficiency of PV energy utilization can be substantially reduced in the absence of a battery. During periods of high solar irradiance, the PV system generates more electricity than is consumed by the household, resulting in excess energy being transferred to the public grid. In the evening, the household then relies on electricity drawn from the grid.

The primary objective of this project is to optimize the use of energy generated by the PV power plant within the household. This is achieved by storing excess energy produced during daylight hours, making it available for consumption during the evening and nighttime.

<h1>Concept</h1>

<article>
The AC battery system comprises a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePo4) battery connected to an AC charger and an inverter. The accompanying diagram illustrates how these components are integrated into the grid, where both the charger and inverter rely on AC from the standard electricity supply, hence the term __"AC battery"__.

However, the processes of converting AC to DC and back to AC are subject to efficiency losses, with each conversion having an efficiency factor of less than 1. As a result, the system experiences a net negative energy balance, meaning that more energy is consumed during charging than is subsequently recovered from the battery. The system compensates for this energy loss through the integration of a PV power plant, which is connected to the AC line and supplies excess energy when charging the battery. The following diagram depicts this configuration.

When the PV system generates surplus energy, it is stored in the battery for later use. The stored energy can then be supplied to power outlets as needed. If the conversion processes are managed effectively, the overall energy balance can become positive.

<h1>System Context</h1>
<article>
At a more conceptual level, the AC battery functions as a device for storing energy from the grid and subsequently feeding it back into the system. An external smart meter monitors the photovoltaic (PV) excess. When excess energy is detected, the battery's charger connects to the AC line to initiate charging. The charger disengages once the excess energy is no longer available. When the battery reaches full capacity or energy demand arises, the inverter connects to the AC line to discharge the stored energy. The following image illustrates the system context.

The AC battery does not operate independently; rather, it is managed by battery management software hosted on a device within the same Wi-Fi network, to which both the AC battery and the smart meter are connected. The management software retrieves data from the smart meter and remotely controls the battery's charger and inverter based on the current energy conditions.

<h3>Networked Units</h3>
<article>
The AC battery incorporates networked embedded devices for controlling and monitoring its operation:  

- **Shelly Plus 1PM**: A Wi-Fi-enabled relay that manages the AC power supply to both the charger and the inverter.
- **ESP32 NodeMCU**: A microcontroller that controls the MOSFET driver board to switch DC power to the inverter and retrieves the battery's State of Charge (SoC) from the shunt.
