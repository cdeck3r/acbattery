# AC Battery System

This project introduces an AC battery designed for integration with a photovoltaic (PV) power plant. 

The system is installed in a residential setting, specifically a single-family home. The PV power plant has a maximum output of 600W, while the battery has a storage capacity of 1kWh. Despite the relatively small scale of this setup, the efficiency of PV energy utilization can be substantially reduced in the absence of a battery. During periods of high solar irradiance, the PV system generates more electricity than is consumed by the household, resulting in excess energy being transferred to the public grid. In the evening, the household then relies on electricity drawn from the grid. 

The primary objective of this project is to optimize the use of energy generated by the PV power plant within the household. This is achieved by storing excess energy produced during daylight hours, making it available for consumption during the evening and nighttime.
